Ignorance Is Not an Excuse Here.</>\r\n\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">Player Behavior Rules:</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> No trolling. Things such as picking up players, kiting, drowning, or going into bases uninvited, pretty standard.. don't be a jerk.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> Don't raid people on PvE servers for any reason; Boss-dropping or anything of the like to smash people's bases will get you instantly banned.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> No in-siding or intentional tribe drama.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> No players or tribes called Human or Bob; you must change your name.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> You MUST create a tribe, even if playing solo. This allows us to help you in case of ark bugs or glitches, etc.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> Don't bring your personal or old server drama into the Game. We do not want to hear it.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> No taking advantage of exploits, cheats, and glitches.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> If you are rude or offensive in the voice chats, you will be muted till you learn; this includes talking inappropriately to ladies or randomly screaming/making noises, or just yelling. This also counts for any unwanted or random sexual advancements, jokes or “creepy talk”.</>\r\n\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">Dino + Creature Rules:</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> Only ten or fewer of each: Gigas, Carchar, Wyverns, Drakes, Reapers, Magmas, and Rexes should be left out while offline for more than 2 hours per tribe/map. We recommend less, but the rule only violates numbers that are more significant than these when players are off the map for 2+ hours. These are some of the leading causes of lag due to animations. Keep as many as you like, but please keep extras Balled up. (Admins may use their discretion to ask you to Ball any tame left out in excess).</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> Don't knock out and run away. If you knock it out, tame it.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> No leaving dinos on mating or wandering. Breed them, then turn them off right away. This will help to prevent extra lag and potential loss of your dinos.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> Don't leave Dinos on the obelisk. If your dino gets transported to a boss fight and dies, it will not be replaced.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> Don’t leave dinos aggressively wandering outside of the base.</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1,0,0,1\">*</><RichColor Color=\"1,0.647,0,1\"> If any issues occur that are out of your hands, such as a glitch, please record a video so an admin can assist. Dinos/items will not be replaced without documentation or dino insurance.</>"
